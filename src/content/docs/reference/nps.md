The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a single-question survey that measures customer experience and loyalty: "How likely are you to recommend our our company to a friend or colleague?" It provides respondents with a scale from 0 to 10 to rate their likelihood. Respondents are considered Promoters if they answer a 9 or 10, Passives if they answer 7 or 8, and Detractors if they answer 0 to 6.
